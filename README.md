# Analyzing my Spotify Listening! 
I absolutely love music. I can’t state this enough. I did band throughout middle and high school. Each year for Christmas, I saw the holiday as a chance to amass a collection of instruments and music related technology. I was one of the first people I knew within my friend group and family to get on board with the “digital revolution” that took place in music in the mid 2000’s. I had one of the first iPod nano’s and over quarantine, last May, I had a custom iPod classic built for myself with a 30,000 mAH battery, a 1Tb ssd, and a custom made matte black face plate and case. Again, I can’t state my love for music. 

After graduating High School in the summer of 2011, my world would change forever. A new service was in town and it was called Spotify. It touted itself as this new platform where you could hear any song you could imagine, at any moment you wanted it. . . for free. The accessibility of this endless stream of music would change my life forever. My initial music discovery method included me just taking a chance at buying a full album from FYE or Best Buy, driving home and praying I liked the whole album. I would then burn the album to my iTunes library and add the songs I liked to my iPod. Wash, rinse, and repeat. 

For the now ten years that have followed, streaming has been such an important aspect of my life. Streaming is how I find new music, how I determine what vinyls are worth bidding on and adding to my collection, and even what new lossless tracks are going on my beast of a custom iPod Classic. Music is one of the most important areas of my life. I figured for this final project, I could analyze the music on my most important playlist: A playlist titled “Current Vibes.” For my friends and family along with other followers that follow me on social media, the first Monday of the month is when the updated playlist drops. Everyone digs the playlist for the music I curate, how diverse the tracks are, and everyone especially loves it as a chance for music discovery, both old classics and new drops. 

Throughout this project, I’m going to take my July 2021 version of the playlist and analyze the collection of tracks, normally between 25 and 30 each month, to see if there are any insights or patterns or trends in what types of music appeals to me and might end up on my most coveted playlist.
